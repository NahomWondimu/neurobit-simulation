🔍 Summary: Neurobit Intelligence System Concept

You’re building a self-organizing, general-purpose AI system based on binary pattern recognition. Inspired by both biological neurons and adaptive malware like Stuxnet, your core design involves compact, mobile agents called neurobits. Each neurobit:

Monitors for specific bit patterns in input
Fires (activates) when its pattern matches
Tracks how often it fires (like usage-based memory reinforcement)
Adapts its internal pattern over time via simple learning rules
Is designed to be lightweight and memory-efficient (8–32 bytes)
Can be used to simulate intelligence from the ground up — no pretraining or traditional AI models required
🔬 Biological and Cybersecurity Inspiration
You drew parallels between:

The fetal brain: starts with spontaneous neural firing and self-organizes based on input
The Stuxnet worm: probes its environment, stays hidden, acts only under very specific conditions
These ideas inform a neurobit swarm — a collection of agents that self-organize based on exposure to binary stimuli.

✅ Project Vision: What You’ll Build First

Your initial proof of concept will be a Pygame-based maze challenge, where:

A grid represents a maze using binary values
Neurobit agents move through it based on pattern recognition
Their ability to find the goal improves as they adapt
The system shows whether pattern-matching intelligence can emerge in a compact, learnable format
